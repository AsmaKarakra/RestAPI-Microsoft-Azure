FastAPI is a modern [and] fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.


Key features of FastAPI#

    Fast: It offers very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). It is considered to be one of the fastest 
     Python frameworks available.

    Fast to code: It increases the speed to develop applications by about 200% to 300%.

    Less bugs: It reduces about 40% of human (developer) induced bugs.

    Intuitive: It offers great editor support. The developer needs to spend less time debugging the code to verify whether the code syntax is correct or not.

    Easy: It is designed to be easy to use and learn. Also, the official documentation is lucid and well structured and thus takes less time to read.

    Short: It supports minimize code duplication. It offers multiple features from each parameter declaration. It also has fewer bugs.

    Robust: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.

    Standards-based: It is based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs, OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON schema.
