Concurrent programming refers to when an application is making progress on more than one task at the same time (concurrently). 
If the computer has only one CPU, the application may not make progress or execute on more than one task at the same time, 
but more than one task is being processed at a time inside the application. 
It does not finish one task before it begins the next.




    Concurrency means executing multiple tasks at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously.


Parallel programming refers to the process whereby a computer makes progress on more than one task simultaneously. 
This usually happens due to more than one CPU or CPU core being present.



    Parallel programming means executing multiple tasks at the same time simultaneously.
